i followed the 0.13 code example to get the language standard of your compiler and faced my first 2 bugs that i successfully dealt with and then created a PrintCPPStandardDebug executable.

its funny cause my goal was to use arrays and loops today for cpp and i did although the code was handed to me it was nice to see how im gonna be using those tools in the future.

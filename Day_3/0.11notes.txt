add the -Werror to your compiler cmd and then it will treat warnings in your code as errors and break the code until the warning is fixed 

So, if you want stricter code quality but still want the program to compile with warnings, don't use -Werror. If you want to force yourself to fix all warnings before compiling, then use -Werror.

2.8 and 2.9 talk about conversion within assignment and within expression 

conversion with assignment u can assign a different type to a different type variable and it would match the type of what its assigned to. if u assign an int to a double it becomes the decimal version. if u assign an int to a char it will match if its between -128 and 127 otherwise remove the all neccesary high order bits and then match. if the target type is not large enough to store result a garbage value will result.

in an expression first all char or short ints are automatically elevated to int this is called integral promotion.

next all operands are converted up to their largest type of operand which is called type promotion

values that are type bool are converted into the ints either 0 or 1; false or true when used in an integer expression.
